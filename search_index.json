Robert Trenholm 2020-01-22 1 Introduction Sea Cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa), a holothurian species common to the North Atlantic ocean, has become economically important in the Newfoundland and Labrador area with increasing commercial harvests since 2003 (DFO (2004), DFO (2017a)). Demand for harvested and processed sea cucumber largely comes from Asian countries where the sea cucumber is perceived to be a delicacy and a health food (Fabinyi (2012), J.-F. Hamel and Mercier (2008), Kiew and Don (2012), Purcell (2014), Toral-Granda, Lovatelli, and Vasconcellos (2008)). Sea cucumber, though economically important for North Atlantic regions, is not normally consumed so handling methods and quality requirements are not well known but are becoming more familiar as experience is gained with the animal. An organized and scientific approach to establishing optimal handling and holding practices is required. Proprietary production methods for the species have been developed responding to Asian buyer’s specifications with major focus on automation. Processes are normally considered commercial secrets as they can provide a quality opportunity with buyers. Little published work is available on the production and associated quality aspects of Cucumaria frondosa which provides the momentum for this proposed work. 1.1 Problem Statement Sorting and grading techniques are required for the sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) processing industry to promote sustainable harvesting, full utilization, traceability and complete marketing potential. Uniform descriptive measures for Cucumaria frondosa are required to establish automated sorting and grading algorithms and methods. Production methods for Cucumaria frondosa in Canada, and more specifically in Newfoundland and Labrador, are being developed to respond to the needs of government and industry. Fisheries and Oceans Canada supports and encourages sustainable fisheries with full traceability on behalf of Canadian citizens (DFO (2018); DFO (2019b)). The Newfoundland Provincial Government has adopted similar recommendations in its Fisheries and Land Resources Plan 2017-20 (Newfoundland and Labrador Government (2017)). In addition, both levels of government encourage the full utilization of harvested materials minimizing wastage. Sortation at the point of harvest can permit the opportunity to extract from the ecosystem only those materials which can be fully utilized and return to the ecosystem materials that are not ready for use thereby optimizing the value of the biomass. This work would like to consider two possible predictive measurement options that can be used to sort and grade live sea cucumbers. Modified Buoyant Mass – the difference between wet mass and the amount of water the animal displaces (related to immersed weight). Morphological Flux – measuring physical changes after stimulation. 1.1.1 Automation Considerations The fish processing industry is largely interested in the profitable and sustainable exploitation of available fish resources but are facing serious shortages in available labor. They are therefore focused on employing automation as much as possible (FPSC (2019)). Automation, by its very nature, requires a defined raw material with predictable, measurable or sortable characteristics. Modelling and associated characterizations are required to establish appropriate automated control (Hitzmann (2017)). Currently very little is known about the specific attributes of Cucumaria frondosa that can be exploited for sortation and grading. Some work has been completed characterizing sea cucumber in terms of size index (SI), and suspended weight (Gianasi, Hamel, and Mercier (2019); Grant (2006); Grant, Squire, and Keats (2006); Hamel et al. (2019); So (2009)) but the accuracy and ease of use and calculation is uncertain. This work serves to explore and establish useable modelling characteristics for this species of sea cucumber. 1.1.2 Quality Considerations 1.1.2.1 Beche-de-mer Quality Measurement The emerging sea cucumber industry in Newfoundland and Labrador is a mono-species industry, harvesting only Cucumaria frondosa (J.-F. Hamel and Mercier (2008); Toral-Granda, Lovatelli, and Vasconcellos (2008); Purcell et al. (2013)). It is harvested using a modified sea urchin drag which provides the means to harvest large quantities of animal in a very short period of time (Barrett, Way, and Winger (2007)). The effect of bulk handling from capture to processing can potentially degrade the quality of large volumes of sea cucumber which can in turn affect the worth of the harvested materials in the marketplace as beche-de-mer. Sea cucumber quality is important to measure at various points in the handling process to establish the effect of handling and holding on the commercial value of materials obtained and to identify areas where improvements are possible or required. In addition, grading the sea cucumber at the plant can provide opportunities to use materials for ancillary purposes if quality attributes are found to be substandard for beche-de-mer. Currently there are few published peer reviewed articles on the measure of quality for sea cucumber in the Cucumaria industry which provides this research opportunity. Guidance documents are available for species of sea cucumber harvested in the Pacific such as that provided by the South Pacific Commission in the New Zealand area (South Pacific Commission (1994)) which can be used to identify appropriate categories of concern. Industrial enterprises use basic measures such as wet weight, size (length, width), drained weights, and organoleptic properties (odor, color, appearance) to establish the quality and value of the sea cucumber (Personal Observations). They generally receive guidance from purchasing agents as to suitability of the raw material and develop their own unpublished standards and specifications for the products they manufacture. Standards and grades developed in the industry are largely company specific and are for beche-de-mer style products with the sea cucumber body wall being the most important component for production. Quality standards must be developed and shared industry-wide for all aspects of the sea cucumber to increase uniformity within the Newfoundland sea cucumber industry. 1.1.2.2 Measuring Quality of All Components of the Sea Cucumber: Processing plants observed in Newfoundland and Labrador consider the gut material and associated components as waste due to the lack of obvious market for these species components. Asian markets consider gut material from sea cucumber, largely japonicus species, as a marketable commodity (Akamine (2015)). Gut material in Cucumaria frondosa has been under investigation for usefulness and may possibly present opportunities for finished products (Zhong, Khan, and Shahidi (2007)). Normally discarded components may then present a business opportunity as the Cucumaria frondosa industry in the North Atlantic area matures. Quality measures will be required for gut components to establish limits to usefulness as well as categorical grading requirements. Given that full utilization of raw material harvested is a general goal for the fishing industry, it follows that opportunities for components of the discards coming from the process should be pursued, which requires establishment of quality and grading standards for these underutilized components. 1.1.2.3 Measuring Quality at Harvest for Efficiency and Conservation Current bulk harvesting methods use limited sortation methods on board the harvesting vessel which currently only remove by-catch, small animals and some rock. Essentially all animals are stored from the drag. Many of the animals harvested, although presenting as the correct size (&gt; 4 inches), have thin body walls or are small animals that are swollen full of water due to active buoyancy adjustment (ABA) (Hamel et al. (2019)). The finished bech-de-mer product coming from these animals will be smaller in size and weight so will likely be of lower value for the market. Identifying the condition (quality) of sea cucumber at harvest gives the opportunity to quickly return underdeveloped and otherwise inferior animals to the sea for continued growth and re-harvesting later. Establishing measures that are somewhat independent of water content may provide useful grading and sorting methods on board the harvesting vessel. 1.1.3 Descriptive Physical Condition Estimators: Establishing the physical nature of the sea cucumber in a way that more accurately predicts the proportion of cucumber components has been a problem for some time. Two methods that have been used in literature are the size index (SI) and immersed weight, description to follow. One method is suggested, modified buoyant mass. 1.1.3.1 Size Index – SI: Grant 2006 and Grant et al. 2006 use size index (SI) to describe the size of the sea cucumber across the range of harvested animals. Size index refers to the product of contracted length (CL) with contracted width (CW) multiplied by 0.1. The SI value obtained in the work was log10 transformed for use (Grant (2006), Grant, Squire, and Keats (2006)). \\[SI=CL\\times CW \\times 0.1\\] 1.1.3.2 Submerged Weight or Immersed Weight: Hannah et al. 2012, Gianasi et al. 2018 and So 2009 use an immersed weight to characterize the sea cucumber. Immersed weight refers to the weight of sea cucumber suspended under water using a submerged balance platform (So (2009), Hannah et al. (2012), Gianasi, Hamel, and Mercier (2018)). 1.1.3.3 Modified Buoyant Mass: Modified buoyant mass refers to the wet mass of the animal less the equivalent water mass of the displaced volume of the animal. \\[MBM = WetMass - (\\rho_{water} \\times Volume_{displaced})\\] Conceptually the modified buoyant mass is a calculation variation of the net forces occurring on the animal under the water. The measurement is similar to immersed weight in result but determined differently. The net force acting on the submerged animal is expressed as a mass instead of force using a scale and a displaced volume measurement technique. 1.1.3.4 Morphometric Flux: Morphometric flux refers to the rate at which the sea cucumber changes its shape during and after stimulation. It is common to observe sea cucumbers contracting with hand manipulation or due to the physical and manipulations during harvesting. Typically sea cucumbers contract to a football or ball shape depending on their physical characteristics. After stimulation is stopped, the animal subsequently relaxes to an elongated shape over time. It is thought that the rates of contraction or relaxation (morphometric flux) can be relatively simple measure of physical condition which can be applied during handling and holding sampling events. 1.1.4 Goal Sorting and grading techniques are required for the sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) processing industry to promote sustainable harvesting, full utilization, traceability and complete marketing potential. Uniform descriptive measures for Cucumaria frondosa are required to establish automated sorting and grading algorithms and methods. This work will serve to establish useful quality measures and analysis techniques that can be used to predictively identify the quality and suitability of sea cucumber during the industrial handling process from harvest to processing from live animals. The ultimate goal of the work is to affect improvements to the current industrial handling, holding and processing methodology to maximize the total value of the resource harvested, to avoid unnecessary resource waste and to promote resource conservation. 1.2 Hypotheses: The following hypotheses are considered in this work: Modified buoyant mass can be used to reliably categorize sea cucumbers for in-line automated assessments. Modified buoyant mass coupled with measured major dimensions of the excited live animal predicts body wall thickness and dehydrated mass of sea cucumber. Morphometric flux coupled with flower position predicts proximity to death and correlates with quality degradation of Cucumaria frondosa. 1.3 Objectives: The objective of this work is centered on building an understanding of measurable predictive attributes of the sea cucumber that can be used for sorting and grading unit operations for live animals. The following main objectives are conceived: To create and assess a mass measure that identifies the characteristics of Cucumaria frondosa without being affected by active buoyancy adjustment (ABA). To create a rapid method for determining modified buoyant mass for Cucumaria frondosa that can be applied in automated systems and to establish its accuracy. To compare sea cucumber characterization methods (SI, immersed weight, modified buoyant mass) for sea cucumber experiencing changing morphology due to active buoyancy adjustment (ABA). To create and evaluate a predictive algorithm that uses sea cucumber characterization methods to predict process measures such as body wall thickness, wet body weight and dried body weight. To establish the relationship between morphometric flux, flower position and animal energy levels and condition. library(knitr) References "],
["literature-review.html", "2 Literature Review 2.1 Sea Cucumber 2.2 Current Sea Cucumber Production Process: 2.3 Important Concepts", " 2 Literature Review 2.1 Sea Cucumber Lambert, 1997, characterises various sea cucumber species. The sea cucumber is, broadly speaking, a soft bodied marine echinoderm within the class holothuroidea that is found in many areas of the world. It is shaped like an elongated cylinder with a mouth on one end and an anus on the other. There are 5 rows of tubed feed running the length of the body evenly spaced around the tube. There are 1 to 2 rows of feeding tentacles around the mouth that are used for harvesting food from the environment (See Figure 2.1 ). Within the body wall there are microscopic calcareous particles referred to as ossicles (Lambert (1997)). It is also gonochoric having two sexes, male and female (Purcell (2010)). Figure 2.1: Fresh sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) landed at dockside. Note the presence of 5 rows of tubed feet running the length of the body. (Image: Rob Trenholm 2018) There are around 1200 - 1300 known species of sea cucumber in the world (Pawson, Pawson, and King (2010); Xu, Su, and Zhao (2015)), but only a small fraction of these, around 70 (Xu, Su, and Zhao (2015)), are currently utilized for commercial purposes. Table 2.1 provides a list of the most common species harvested for Asian markets. In the Indo-Pacific area 36 different species are exploited to some level (Toral-Granda, Lovatelli, and Vasconcellos (2008)). Of these species, three main ones are generally agreed to be the most important for that region due to their acceptable physical traits for Asian markets: Apostichopus japonicus, Holothuria scabra, and Isosticopus fuscus (Mercier and Hamel (2013)). See Figures 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. Sea Cucumber species are also common on the Eastern and Western seaboards of North America but currently only two main species are currently commercially exploited: Parastichopus californicus along the north-western seaboard of North America (Figure 2.5) and Cucumaria frondosa, the focus of this work, along the colder north-eastern seaboard (Figure 2.1). Paristichopus parvimensis is also reported to be harvested in Mexico and California, USA (J.-F. Hamel and Mercier (2008)).

Image source: wikimedia.org (public domain). 2.1.1 Active Buoyancy Adjustment (ABA) An important characteristic of some species of sea cucumber, specifically Cucumaria frondosa, is its ability to actively change its buoyancy by drawing water into its body (Hamel et al. (2019)). Active buoyancy adjustment (ABA) enables the sea cucumber to more easily be affected by currents in the ocean and thereby move from place to place. Individual harvested animals can therefore have potentially many different shapes depending on their stage of ABA. This is an important consideration when handing, sorting and grading sea cucumber at harvest and processing. The work of Hamel et al., 2019, showed that Cucumaria frondosa responds to various stimuli, such as increased population density, changes in salinity or turbidity, by increasing its retained water and releasing podia (legs) from contact surfaces. Currents are then be able to more easily move the animal from place to place. Floating and tumbling mechanisms were shown to be important mobility options. Sea cucumbers were shown to respond to such stimuli by changing their water to flesh ratio from around 0.5 to around 3.8. Animals able to change their volumes at will, or in response to stimuli during harvest, can potentially make size based sorting and grading very difficult. Wall thicknesses and animal age or harvest suitability will be difficult to assess with external measurements. 2.1.2 Immersed Weight ABA has made the comparison of Cucumaria frondosa sizes and stages of growth and development difficult. Immersed weight has been used to more reliably compare these animals (Gianasi, Hamel, and Mercier (2018); Hannah et al. (2012); So, Hamel, and Mercier (2010); So (2009)). So, 2009, compared measurements of SI, stimulated length and width with immersed weight and found that immersed weight more reliably described the physical mass changes seen in sea cucumber. Immersed weight is measured by determining the weight of the sea cucumber under the water by using a submerged platen style balance (Justin J. So, 2009). Immersed weight is very similar to the proposed modified buoyant mass. 2.1.3 Important Components of Sea Cucumber Lambert, 1997 and Pawson, et. al., 2010, discuss the anatomy of the sea cucumber providing a description of the main components. Figure 2.6, borrowed from Pawson et al., 2010, shows a dissection of a cucumariid holothurian with the general components labeled. The main components of concern for marketing purposes are (Mao, Huang, and Liu (2015)): the body wall and its parts with calcareous ring (tentacles or “flower”) removed, the calcareous ring (tentacles or “flower”), the gonad and remaining gut material. Figure 2.6: Image of Parastichopus californicus. Image source: wikimedia.org (public domain). 2.1.4 Sea Cucumber Resource Assessment Global sea cucumber resources are prone to overfishing and poor management due to their long maturation times and ease of harvest (Purcell et al. (2013); Purcell, Williamson, and Ngaluafe (2018); So, Hamel, and Mercier (2010)). Global resources come from either sustainably harvested or recovering developed fisheries, new underexploited fisheries, illegal fisheries, or aquaculture. 2.1.4.1 Global Sea Cucumber Production The FAO.org online database for Global Production statistics, Fisheries Statistics Collections, indicates that 276,351 tonnes of sea cucumber were produced in 2017. See Table 2.2. Of this quantity, 241,801 tonnes, 83.79% were produced in Asia. The Americas, which includes Canada, produced 19,870 tonnes, or 7.19%. Canada produced only 3.59% of production worldwide split between the East and West Coast of the country and the two main species: Parastichopus californicus, Cucumaria frondosa. The database also shows that the species most produced in Asia is the Apostichopus japonicus species with 231,552 tonnes produced in 2017. The FAO Aquaculture Production Database indicates that 222,747 tonnes of sea cucumber were aquaculturally produced globally (80.6% of global production). Most of this production, around 222,000 tonnes, was Apostichopus japonicus produced in Asia and Europe (99.7% of global aquaculture). Production of Holothuria scabra, 433 tonnes. Other species production approximated 500 tonnes. Table 2.2: Commercially utilized species from the Indo-Pacific area, the North Pacific and the North Atlantic. (Toral-Granda et al., 2008) Description Quantity (tonnes) – 2017 Production Percentage Africa (Note 1) 1,477 0.53% Americas (Note 2) 19,870 7.19% Canada 9,922 3.59% Asia (Note 3) 231,552 83.79% Europe (Note 4) 12,598 4.56% Other (Note 5) 3.93% Total Production Worldwide 276,351 100% Aquaculture Production Apostichopus japonicus Asia 220,039 79.62% Europe 1,965 0.71% Holothuria scabra Africa 101 0.04% Asia 142 0.05% Other Species - Asia 500 0.18% Total Aquaculture Production Worldwide 222,747 80.60% Notes: 1. Africa includes all countries on the African continent. 2. All countries in North and South America. 3. All countries on the Asian continent including Indo-Pacific regions. 4. All countries in the European continent including the UK and Russian Federation. 5. Other includes Oceania and USSR. From this data, it can be shown that the largest interest in the Asian marketplace is with the japonicus species. Demand for sea cucumber follows with the economic condition of those consuming it (Fabinyi (2012)). The current demand for sea cucumber exceeds the supply, however, so other species presumably serve to fill a void where aquaculture and wild fisheries are not able to sustainably supply raw material to meet the demand. The marketplace may also have an interest in consuming more exotic species of sea cucumber as well. 2.1.5 Sea Cucumber Harvesting Sea cucumber harvesting methods are different in different areas of the world (Toral-Granda, Lovatelli, and Vasconcellos (2008)). The choice of harvesting methodology will largely be impacted by the sea bottom topography of the area being fished. Dragger technology will not work well on substantially rocky areas or on areas that are very shallow. In the Indo-Pacific area much of the sea cucumber is harvested manually by diving. In some areas of the region fishers are not permitted to use SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) or other assistance in harvesting sea cucumber. This limits the quantity of sea cucumber that can be harvested. It also allows harvesters to access multiple species in a single harvest (Purcell et al. (2013)). Along the Western seaboard of North America, harvesting is performed using divers who are permitted to use SCUBA (DFO (2019c)). In areas of Japan, the USSR and Eastern North America a type of towed drag is used for harvesting sea cucumber. The drag used in Eastern North America is a modified sea urchin drag (Barrett, Way, and Winger (2007); DFO (2017b), DFO (2017a)). See Figure . Figure 2.7: Image of a sea cucumber drag used in Eastern North America. Main components are the front-end iron work sled, chain grid, chaffing mat, net bag. Image borrowed from Barrett et al. 2007. 2.1.6 Sustainability Wild capture fisheries are prone to overfishing and associated resource depletion which may result in a boom and bust style of supply. A paper by Anderson et al., 2011 shows that many developed sea cucumber fisheries have experienced a surge of production after initiating a commercial relationship with sea cucumber buyers. Following the surge, the fisheries were either discontinued or sharply reduced in volume as the resource was rapidly depleted. The paper shows how this effect has been experienced by many areas such as: The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Tanzania, Solomon Islands, Indonesia, Madagascar, New Caledonia, Fiji, Philippines, to name a few (Anderson et al. (2011)). Christensen 2011 shares a similar story for the Solomon Islands (Christensen (2011)). Fisheries that are emerging, such as the fishery in the Newfoundland and Labrador area of Canada, are experiencing the first surge of interest from buyers which may result in a similar pattern of resource use if management processes are not properly implemented. A precautionary approach has been suggested to limit any boom and bust effect (FAO (2010); Jean-François Hamel and Mercier (2008)). 2.1.7 Aquaculture Apostichopus japonicus has been grown aquaculturally since the 1950s in response to the results of overfishing of that species in the Asian area (G. Liu, Sun, and Liu (2015)). As outlined earlier, this species is the main cultivated species for Asia accounting for 99.7% of global aquaculture in 2017. Other species such as Holothuria scabra and Isostichopus fuscus have been focused on as well, (Mercier and Hamel (2013); Xu, Su, and Zhao (2015)) although H. scabra seems to be the more significant of these two given the 2017 production numbers in Table 2. A recent article in Aquaculture North America indicates that efforts are being expended to produce Parastichopus californicus using aquaculture as well (Walker (2017)). The following steps are usually undertaken for aquaculture production of sea cucumber (Chen (2003); Han, Keesing, and Liu (2016); Hou et al. (2019); H. Liu et al. (2015)): brood stock is obtained and controlled fertilization is promoted. fertilized and established juvenile sea cucumber are then introduced in various stages of grow-out pens in controlled ocean environments. eventually sea cucumbers are transferred into natural but closed environments to complete their growth. mature sea cucumbers are harvested when they reach marketable size. Growth rates of sea cucumbers are different for different species and their normalized environmental temperatures which impacts the viability of any species for aquaculture use. For instance Cucumaria frondosa has been reported to be very slow growing in its natural environment growing from juvenile sea cucumbers to adults in approximately 10 - 25 years (FAO (2010); So (2009)). 2.1.7.1 Innovative Aquaculture Models Recently work has been completed using sea cucumber as a waste control measure and symbiotic growth species on aquaculture sites. Conceptually sea cucumber would be able to feed on waste coming from fin fish or shellfish aquaculture pens reducing the environmental impact of the combined operation, saving on feed, and producing high value sea cucumber as well (J.-F. Hamel and Mercier (2008); Nelson, MacDonald, and Robinson (2012); Neofitou et al. (2019); Ren et al. (2012); Xia et al. (2017)). Work will need to be completed on this for cold water species to evaluate the effect of the environment on the nature of sea cucumber raw material produced. 2.1.8 The North Atlantic Sea Cucumber Resource: The sea cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) fishery in the Newfoundland and Labrador area is classed as an emerging fishery. Two main geographical areas are exploited at this time, south east and north west of the “French Corridor” in NAFO Division 3Ps off the southern shore of the island. Figure 2.8 shows a partial map of the area fished (DFO (2017a)). Figure 2.8: Image showing the current fishing grounds for sea cucumber. The main areas are North West and South East of the French Corridor in NAFO area 3Ps. Image borrowed from DFO, 2017. Currently, 2019, the total allowable catch (TAC) for the resource is 7,016 tonnes up from 6,016 tonnes in 2018 (DFO (2019a)) which must be harvested between June 1st and December 31st of each year. Management measures include harvesting caps per vessel, dockside monitoring, electronic vessel monitoring, reporting requirements and at-sea observer coverage. 2.1.9 Historical Uses Sea cucumber has been in demand in Asia since the 16th or 17th century, AD, and has been shown to be important for trade in as early as the 2nd Century AD (G. Liu, Sun, and Liu (2015); Yang and Bai (2015)). The earliest references to sea cucumber use are around 269 to 280 AD with the main industries and trade being established by the middle of the 18th century (G. Liu, Sun, and Liu (2015)). Sea cucumber was initially consumed primarily by the imperial court of China as it was considered to be a valuable health food (Yang and Bai (2015)). In traditional Chinese medicine the sea cucumber, or Hai Sheng (ginseng of the sea), is purported to regulate the heart, kidney and lung activities while promoting spermatogenesis, curing impotence, enriching the blood, normalizing menstruation and improving kidney health (Yang and Bai (2015)). The historical connection to value and health makes the sea cucumber a valuable commodity in current Asian markets (Xu, Su, and Zhao (2015)). In Malaysia sea cucumber is often referred to as “gamat” where it is used as a medicinal ingredient and health food (Toral-Granda, Lovatelli, and Vasconcellos (2008)). 2.1.10 Markets The main markets for sea cucumber are found in the Asian areas such as China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Consumption of sea cucumber usually coincides with a special occasion (special meal or gift giving) or for assigned Chinese medicine treatments (Xu, Su, and Zhao (2015)). It is connected to establishing relationships and social status in Chinese culture (Fabinyi (2012)). Sea cucumber price varies with the size of the animal and market acceptability (Purcell (2014); Purcell, Williamson, and Ngaluafe (2018)). Generally prices ex-vessel range from $2.00 to $5.00 per kg (Jean-François Hamel and Mercier (2008)). Currently the average wholesale price for Global sea cucumber Beche-de-Mer is around $20.52 USD per kg (Tridge (2019)). Mao et al., 2015, reviews the typical process forms common to the Asian marketplace. The authors itemize the following main categories: Fresh Sea Cucumbers: live (See Figure 2.9), ready to eat, pressure cooked (canned) Dried Sea Cucumbers: salted dried, unsalted dried, freeze dried, other dried (hot air, heat pump, cold air, microwave) By-products (Deep Processed): guts and flowers, deep processed (powders and extracts) Some of the diverse species available in the Indo-Pacific area are sold for the aquarium trade as well (Verónica. Toral-Granda et al., 2008). Figure 2.9: Live market of sea cucumber in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. Image source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-leone-seacucumbers/chinas-hunger-for-sea-cucumbers-reaches-islands-of-sierra-leone-idUSKBN0DI0BI20140502 An assessment of Japanese products consumed is given by Akamine 2015 referring to namako (fresh sea cucumber), iriko (dried sea cucumber) and konowata (fermented sea cucumber intestine medicinal), konoko (sea cucumber ovaries) (Akamine (2015)). Nutraceuticals and supplements are becoming important to North American and European markets as purchasers learn about the benefits of consuming sea cucumber (Bordbar, Anwar, and Saari (2011); Fredalina et al. (1999); García et al. (2019); Kiew and Don (2012); Pangestuti and Arifin (2018); Wargasetia and Widodo (2017)). Interesting developments around the function of sea cucumber extracts on cancerous cells may also increase the demand for sea cucumber around the world (Janakiram, Mohammed, and Rao (2015); Wargasetia and Widodo (2017)). Also, non-food or non-medicinal applications may influence demand such as the development of adhesives or other useful compounds (Flammang, Santos, and Haesaerts (2005)). Table 2.3 provides a snapshot of different companies that are currently marketing sea cucumber-based secondary products online. Many of these companies are producing products from and for North American consumers. Table 2.3: Examples of online companies selling sea cucumber, sea cucumber extracts, powders and parts.

The body wall of the animal is dehydrated for preservation, either salted or unsalted, and is sold as ‘trepang’, ‘haishen’ (sea gensing), ‘gamat’, or beche-de-mer (Mao, Huang, and Liu (2015); South Pacific Commission (1994)). Four main dried products are typically prepared: 1 salted dried sea cucumbers, 2 sugar dried sea cucumbers, 3 unsalted dried sea cucumbers, 4 frozen dried sea cucumbers. Suppliers of sea cucumbers in areas of the world far from the Asian marketplace, or with fewer processing alternatives (lack of power or technology for instance), will focus on alternative processes that permit the products to be shipped at lower cost while maintaining a useable product. Dehydration is one of the main forms of preparation that can be uniformly adopted. Current production in Eastern and Western North America use dehydration as well as bulk frozen packaging options which permits further processing in Asia to final product forms (DFO (2017a), DFO (2019c)). 2.1.10.1 Preparation of Sea Cucumber for Consumption The establishment of opportunity in a marketplace requires that one understands the way the product is being used and the expectations of performance. As described previously, the largest use of sea cucumber is for human consumption in the Asian marketplace. The most complex and time-consuming preparation steps are for fresh and dehydrated sea cucumber. Other product forms for consumption, such as pills, capsules and ready to eat alternatives, are relatively easy to use and requires little preparation. Mao et al., 2015, provides a good explanation of the preparation steps required for fresh and dried sea cucumber. There are also many videos describing the preparation steps for fresh or dried sea cucumber species on video streaming services such as YouTube. The preparation process for sea cucumber is long and involved, requiring up to 5 days preparation time. The process can vary depending on the species being cooked or re-hydrated. The cooking processes have been developed over many hundreds of years and as such are a likely expectation when preparing sea cucumber from dehydrated sources. The preparation performance of dehydrated sea cucumber using these methodologies may be very important as the consumer will have experience preparing dishes using these processes and will have expectations of performance over time. Dried sea cucumber from different areas of the world should perform similarly. There may be opportunity for creating value added products that circumvent or shorten this process. Mao et al. 2015 and Xu et al. 2015 refers to “instant” sea cucumber that has been pre-cooked and sold ready to use to assist with preparation methods. 2.1.10.2 Increasing Global Demand Demand has begun to increase in North America and Europe for sea cucumber as the potential health benefits of sea cucumber are recognized. Processed options are becoming more readily available. Web sites selling sea cucumber and its forms to North Americans are becoming more prevalent (ie. http://beche.ca). Consult Table 3 for examples of secondary products currently available for sale in global markets. 2.2 Current Sea Cucumber Production Process: Brennan et al. 1981 describes plant operations in terms of a sequence of unit operations. Categorically, foods are prepared using preliminary operations to manage the raw material and its variations, conversion operations are used to usefully change the form of the raw material, and preservation operations are used to extend the useable life of the food to the point of sale or consumption. See Figure 2.10. Figure 2.10: Schematic flow of categories of unit operation in a processing plant. Raw material and packaging are subject to preliminary operations followed by conversion and then preservation operations. All aspects of production use materials handling and waste treatment unit operations. Preliminary operations include unit operations such as sorting, grading, cleaning, ordering. Conversion operations include operations such as cutting, slicing, dicing, fermentation, cooking, and so on. Preservation operations consider all means for extending useable life of the food product created such as dehydration, pasteurization, sterilization, modified atmosphere packaging, high pressure processing, and so on. Often conversion operations overlap with preservation operations as with dehydration, fermentation, and so on (Brennan et al. (1981)). The sea cucumber processing plants can be assessed using the same overall terminology. 2.2.1 Preliminary Operations: 2.2.1.1 Harvest to Plant: Sea cucumber is normally harvested using a modified sea urchin drag on the St. Pierre Bank in NAFO division 3Ps. Vessels acquire 90,000 to 100,000 lb of sea cucumber prior to landing. Net mesh sizes on the drag provide some control on size of cucumber gathered (Barrett, Way, and Winger (2007)). The flow chart in Figure 2.11 describes the process flow from the drag on the vessel to the chiller in the processing plant. Most materials from the NAFO 3Ps area in Newfoundland and Labrador are landed somewhere on the Burin Peninsula and are either trucked to points of use on the island or are used in place if the plant is adjacent to the landing wharf. Handling methods will differ slightly if the sea cucumber must be shipped over long distances. Figure 2.11: Flow chart describing the handling process from vessel to the plant. Generally speaking, sea cucumber is harvested using a modified sea urchin drag (Barrett, Way, and Winger (2007); Grant (2006); Grant, Squire, and Keats (2006)) and is brought to the stern of the boat where it is initially sorted. Non-relevant species and stone are returned to the sea. The remaining sea cucumber is bulk stowed via chute in the hold of the vessel where it is prevented from physically shifting using temporary compartment walls called ‘batter-boards’. Harvesting continues until the vessel has reached capacity (Approximately 100,000 lb) involving several tows. Once the vessel has reached capacity it then travels to a wharf for unloading. Transport times from the fishing grounds to the wharf are typically around 15 hours. Once at the wharf, sea cucumber is transferred out of the vessel hold to the dock manually via either a vacuum system or via a hoist. This can take between 2 and 4 hours depending on the removal method used. Sea cucumber is transferred to a bar screen sorter to remove any rock present. The sea cucumber moves from the sorter and weighed into 4x4 insulated fish containers. Tallied weights are credited to the vessel and forms the basis for payment coupled with the information collected from the dockside grader (Sampled weights, drained weights, size, appearance, etc.). Each 4x4 container is topped with ice and a bit of salt to help maintain a lowered temperature on the dock. The insulated containers and cucumbers remain on the dock until transport to the plant either directly, if landed at the plant itself, or via transport truck, if the plant is many kilometers away. Trucking durations can be 4 to 6 hours or more. Once offloaded at the processing facility, containers of sea cucumbers are organized into groups and are processed as soon as possible. Delays are common requiring that sea cucumber be delayed in processing for several hours. 2.2.1.2 Dockside and Plant Gate Grading Dockside grading is completed at the wharf where the landed sea cucumber is sampled during unloading. The number of sample sets obtained during the unloading are variable according to the fish load. An observed example (Fortune, NL, 2018): &lt;10,000 lbs – 3 lots 10,001 – 20,000 lbs – 4 lots 20,001 – 30,000 lbs – 5 lots 30,001 – 40,000 bs – 6 lots For every additional 10,000 lbs landed an additional sample lot is to be taken. Each sample set consists of 30 animals randomly selected. The gross weight, percent of water, percent foreign material, percent undersize and percent damaged or punctured are determined for each set. Percent water is determined by cutting the sidewall of the sea cucumber longitudinally (anal end to flower) and allowing the opened animal to drain through a screen for 30 minutes. The body wall opening was positioned downward on the screen for the duration. See Figure 2.12. Figure 2.12: Sea cucumber draining on screen during dockside grading check. (Photo by Robert Trenholm, 2018) A similar grading scheme is completed at the plant to verify any changes that may have occurred during transport. After the second grading is complete the animals are processed through the plant using conversion and preservation operations as described below. Animals displaying obvious differences in color, size and condition are removed during handling. No data is recorded for these removals. 2.2.2 Conversion and Preservation Operations After evaluation, sea cucumber landed at the plant is processed using controlled and automated processes. Whole sea cucumber is eviscerated, cleaned and segmented as required. Prepared sea cucumber components are either pasteurized, dehydrated and bulk bagged or are frozen in bulk boxes for shipment to remote buyers. 2.2.2.1 Production Process in Plant: The following flowchart shows an outline of the manufacturing processes observed in 2018 and 2019 in two plants in Newfoundland and Labrador. The processes are set up to produce products that are sent for further processing in Asia. Interim product processes, then, have quality goals which are not related to the end-product requirements. Figure 2.13: Flow chart showing several finished product streams for sea cucumber in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. In general, there are two main methods employed for stabilization of the finished products: dehydration and freezing. A recent visit to a sea cucumber processing facility in St. Lawrence, NL, revealed that there are three main products provided for sale namely: Eviscerated and dehydrated sea cucumber with flower removed. Eviscerated IQF (individually quick frozen) sea cucumber body wall with flower removed. Blanched and IQF whole sea cucumber. All transfers within the plant are accomplished either by conveyor or chute or are accommodated by manual transfer of materials using pans and pallet jacks. All finished product forms seemed to be a common 10 kg bag in box or bulk bagged dehydrated product. It is important to note that many of the specific handling processes employed at the processing facilities including parameters of operation are considered confidential. 2.2.3 Process Waste The sea cucumber process in Newfoundland and Labrador mostly uses the body wall and flower of the cucumber. The viscera is typically discarded. Table 2.4 shows the proximate composition of the viscera that is normally discarded (Mamelona, Saint-Louis, and Pelletier (2010)). Table 2.5 shows the proximate analysis of the eviscerated animal and with viscera intact (Zhong, Khan, and Shahidi (2007)). Table 2.4: Proximate composition of Atlantic sea cucumber viscera (SCV) adapted from (Mamelona, Saint-Louis, and Pelletier (2010)). Chemical composition (%) SCV Moisture 92.3 ± 3.2 Protein 4.5 ± 0.7 Fat 2.0 ± 0.2 Carbohydrates 0.3 ± 0.0 Ash 0.7 ± 0.3 Data are expressed as mean ± SD from triplicate determination.

Abbreviations: F, fresh sea cucumber without internal organs; F + O, fresh sea cucumber with internal organs; R, rehydrated sea cucumber without internal organs; and R + O, rehydrated sea cucumber with internal organs. These tables show that although there is a large quantity of water in the process there is a significant amount of protein and fat. Zhong, et al, 2007, indicate that much of the fats in the sea cucumber are unsaturated and are of the omega 3 and 6 variety which has been shown to be important in the human diet. The proteins remaining may also be very useful. Amino acids and other polypeptides may find some use in other food utilization. Japan will use the viscera of the sea cucumber of some species as a special product form known as “konowata” (Kasai (2003)). It is usually either pickled or served with a type of sushi. It is considered a health food. Further work should be completed on determining an appropriate means of gathering the gut material as a useable raw material for other secondary products. 2.2.4 Alternative Products from Sea Cucumber: There are many opportunities for further products from the sea cucumber beyond those currently marketed. Bordbar, et al, 2011, describes opportunities for vitamins, minerals and bio-actives (Bordbar, Anwar, and Saari (2011)). The following list provides some ideas for exploitation coming from the same paper: Vitamins and Minerals: Vitamin A, Vitamin B1 (thiamine), Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B3 (niacin), and minerals, especially calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc. Bio-actives: Triterpene glycosides (saponins), chondroitin sulfates, glycosaminoglycan (GAGs), sulfated polysaccharides, sterols (glycosides and sulfates), phenolics, cerberosides, lectins, peptides, glycoprotein, glycosphingolipids, essential fatty acids and collagen. In the current process, sea cucumber is processed into various forms of body wall with the viscera removed and discarded. Fortunately, this separation process takes place inside the processing plant which allows for these materials to be retained in a controlled fashion. Viscera coming from either automated machinery or the manual cleaning tables can be retained and used. If subcomponents of the gut material, such as the respiratory tree, intestines or the gonads, are required then other means will be required for evisceration. Further refinement can then be undertaken depending on the usefulness of the component. In addition, if undersized sea cucumber cannot be shipped due to market size limitations then these animals can be used to prepare other high value extracts such as chondroitin sulphate or collagen, etc. Alternative products such as these will require quality standards which will be developed in this work. 2.3 Important Concepts 2.3.1 Buoyancy The concept of buoyancy follows from a generally understood Archimedes’ principle that states that the buoyant force experienced by an object submerged is equal to the weight of fluid it volumetrically displaces. The net forces acting on a submerged body, its buoyancy, then follow from fluid statics where upward and downward forces are summed to obtain an overall net force. If the net force is downward, the object will sink, if upward it will float (Roberson and Crowe (1985); Shames (1982)). “Immersed weight”, as previously discussed, refers to the buoyant weight of sea cucumber which is a direct measure of the net forces acting on the animal under the water. Determination of immersed weight while the animal is out of water, post harvest, requires an understanding of displaced volume and wet weight which can be used to estimate the same buoyant measure. 2.3.2 Image Processing Image processing is used in food systems to automatically sort and grade raw materials at high plant rates (Hitzmann (2017)). Matlab is a software program that can interpret the images taken during the sorting and grading process and calculate physical parameters from them (Marques (2011)). Matlab has been used to assess the body weight of Apostichopus japonicus in 2015 (H. Liu et al. (2015)) so should be useful in assessing Cucumaria frondosa. Work completed by Liu et al. 2015 provides the background for image processing work within this proposal. References "],

More detailed explanation of the experimental plan will be found in the next section, Experimental Design. 3.1 Experimental Materials 3.1.1 Sea Cucumber Samples Sea cucumber samples will be acquired in one of two ways: From seasonal landings on the Burin Peninsula from current fisheries efforts. From diver fisheries managed by the Ocean Sciences Centre of Memorial University. 3.1.2 Live Sea Cucumber Storage and Holding Sea cucumbers will either be stored in the Marine Institute in the salt water holding system or in available holding systems in the Ocean Sciences Center. Salt water used for the Marine Institute system will be obtained from the Ocean Sciences Center. 3.2 Experimental Equipment and Hardware/Software 3.2.1 Weights and Measures Weights will be obtained using a ___ balance (____). 1 liter and 2 liter volumetric cylinders (Fisher Scientific, USA) will be used to assess displaced volume. A fish board will be used to assess lengths and to facilitate photographic analysis. Calipers () will be used to establish cucumber wall thicknesses. A Canon DSLR camera (Canon, USA) with a tripod will be used to obtain analysis images. 3.2.2 Laboratory Equipment Body wall pH will be determined as per Woyewoda et al. (1986), using a pH meter (Hach, USA) with Waring blender, 25 ml, and 50 ml beakers (Fisher Scientific) and thermometer (Fisher Scientific). 3.2.3 Handling and Processing Fish totes, pans, scalpels, knives, ice and transport will be provided by the CASD, Marine Institute of Memorial University. A ____ dehydration system () will be used to dehydrate sea cucumber samples. Small, medium and large sized Ziploc bags will be used to store interim samples. Plastic trays will be obtained from ______ (). Refrigeration and freezing storage requirements will be provided by CASD cold store systems () at the Marine By-products Plant on Mount Scio Rd. 3.2.4 Software MATLAB will be used to assess images obtained. R statistical analysis software (_____) will be used to analyse the data obtained. 3.3 Experimental Methods 3.3.1 Characterizing Sea Cucumber Size and Yield 3.3.1.1 Determination of SI Grant (2006), uses a measure of size index, SI, to assess different sea cucumber sizes and establish relationships with finished product characteristics. Size index is calculated from the fully stimulated cucumber length multiplied by its width multiplied by 0.1. This calculation will be used as a comparator for the proposed research. 3.3.1.2 Determination of Immersed Weight Immersed weight is determined by suspending a basket on the end of a balance and then submerging the basket into water. Sea cucumber are placed in the basket while submerged and the weight is measured directly. 3.3.1.3 Determination of Modified Buoyant Mass The modified buoyant mass is a measure similar to immersed weight. The volume displaced by the sea cucumber multiplied by the density of pure water is subtracted from its wet mass. 3.3.1.3.1 Mass-Volume Displacement Technique The following methodology will be used to establish a laboratory scale estimation of modified buoyant mass (MBM). A 1 or 2-litre plastic volumetric cylinder and a 4000g +/- 0.1 g scale will be used to assess the wet weight, the displaced volume and the associated immersed weight by calculation. 4 litres of a 3.5% solution of salt water, equivalent to sea water salinity, will be created for use in the experiment to reduce live sample interactions. A 1 or 2 litre plastic volumetric cylinder will be filled to approximately 500 ml and placed on a scale. The initial mass (\\(M_i\\)) and water volume of the assembly (\\(V_i\\)) will be accurately determined and recorded. A single sea cucumber will be dropped into the water which will settle to the bottom of the cylinder. (If the animal floats then air is likely entrained and will negate the test.) The new mass will be recorded (\\(M_f\\)) and the new volume in the cylinder (\\(V_f\\)). Wet mass will be calculated by difference from the measurements. \\[M_{wet}=M_{f}-M_{i}\\] Displaced volume will be calculated by the following relationship: \\[V_{cucumber}=V_{f}-V_{i}\\] Note that the displaced volume can be attained by marking the initial volume in the cylinder and then the final after introduction of the cucumber or the opposite, determining the new volume after the animal is removed. Immersed mass or modified buoyant mass (MBM) will be calculated using the following formula: \\[MBM=(M_f-M_i)-((V_f-V_i )×\\rho_{water})\\] The MBM will be the difference between the wet mass of the cucumber (\\(M_f-M_i\\)) and mass of the water entrained within the cucumber (\\((V_f-V_i)×\\rho_{water}\\)). The resulting immersed mass is a value that approximates the components of the sea cucumber that are not water. The density of the water will be assumed to be 1000 \\(kg.m^-3\\), as per water at 5°C. Other methods can be envisioned that may be easier to perform. Any revisions to methods will use the same overall methodology, however. 3.3.1.3.2 Ellipsoid volume calculation Sea cucumbers (Cucumaria frondosa) are commonly shaped as an ellipsoid when fully stimulated immediately after harvest (Figure 2.1). It is suggested that major dimensions of the fully excited animal can be used to estimate the displaced volume. Values a, b and c correspond to: a) sea cucumber excited length, anus to tentacle closure, b) vertical width, c) horizontal width. The ellipsoid volume calculation is established through calculus by considering incremental changes in cross sectional area along the a axis (x axis) moving from the center of the object to either end. Each cross sectional area is denoted by an ellipse with formula: \\[A_x=\\pi bc\\] The ellipse curve is described by the following relationship: \\[x^2/a^2 +y^2/b^2 =1\\] And, \\(y^2=b^2 (1-x^2/a^2 )\\) Substituting incremental area into the relationship for volume of a solid and using the layer technique in integration: \\[V=\\int_{-a}^{a} \\pi y^2 dx\\] Yielding the following: \\[V=2 b^2 \\pi \\int_{0}^{a} \\left (1-\\frac{x^2}{a^2} \\right ) dx\\] Which simplifies to: \\[V_{ellipsoid}=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi abc\\] Where a, b and c are the radius measurements of the main axes of the object as follows: Figure 3.1: Image borrowed from https://www.web-formulas.com/Math_Formulas/Geometry_Volume_of_Ellipsoid.aspx. Major dimension measurements are obtained using a fish measuring board and are used via calculation to estimate displaced volume. The displaced volume is multiplied by the density of pure water to obtain the mass of water displaced which is subtracted from the wet mass of the cucumber to attain the MBM. 3.3.1.3.3 Volume Estimates using MATLAB In a similar manner to the mathematic derivation of ellipsoid volume, MATLAB will be used to establish the characteristics of the sea cucumber dimensions through image processing. Vertical images will be taken of each sea cucumber while held in the fish measuring board. Stimulated lengths, vertical and horizontal widths and wet mass will be recorded as metadata for each image and will be stored for later use. Images, essentially two-dimensional pixel matrices, will be processed using MATLAB such that the image is represented by binary information, essentially pixel values of 0 or 1. The sea cucumber body will be represented as white (a value of 1) and the background, including the measuring board, will be represented as black (a value of 0). The binary pixel matrix representation can then be used to calculate volume by breaking the image up into vertical layers, see Figure 3.2. Figure 3.2: Image showing a representation of the evaluation approach. Sea cucumber widths from left to right will be used to represent circular or elliptical cross sections. These layers will be used to calculate incremental volumes which will be integrated (summed) from end to end to produce a displaced volume estimate. Each image will be assessed for volume by evaluating the image along the vertical dimension. The physical length of each vertical component across the image of the cucumber will be determined by associating a number of image pixels with a physical length through the evaluation of image scale. Each vertical line across the sea cucumber image will be spaced by a number of pixels which will represent an incremental cross section of the animal. Each cross section will be treated either as a circle or as an ellipse depending on the observed phenomenon. The volume of each layer will be calculated as per a cylinder volume with circular or elliptical cross section. Each layer of sea cucumber will represent an incremental volume of the animal which will be summed to provide an estimate of the displaced volume. The displaced volume determined from this process will be multiplied by the density of water and the result subtracted from the original wet weight to estimate the MBM. 3.3.2 Assessing Morphometric Flux as a Predictor for Energy Levels and Condition 3.3.2.1 Animal Stimulation Each animal will be stimulated such that it contracts fully without further physical change with continued stimulation. Initially it is expected that manual manipulation will be required to obtain the extent of stimulation. Each animal will be picked up by hand and massaged to stimulate contraction. A timer will be used to establish the rate at which the animal contracts. A video camera will used to record the observed stimulation phenomena and to assist with assessing the best means of uniform stimulation in the field. The vigorousness of the stimulation will be altered and observed initially to establish the best stimulation method. Times for full stimulation will be recorded. 3.3.2.2 Morphometric Relaxation flux Fully stimulated animals will be placed on pre-weighed screens and an image will be taken initially. The animal initial wet weight will be determined. A timer will be started. After 5 minutes and 10 minutes of elapsed time, another image will be taken and animal weight repeated. The change in animal dimensions will be observed and recorded. Any observations of physical changes will be recorded as well. 3.3.2.3 Body Wall pH The pH determination method by Woyewoda et al. (1986) will be used. A 20 g composite sample of the body wall of each sea cucumber will be obtained from the dorsal and ventral areas of the cucumber evenly distributed along the body wall. The samples will be placed in a waring blender and blended with 40 ml distilled water at room temperature for 1 minute. Some of the slurry will be poured into a 50 ml beaker and a calibrated and standardized pH probe placed into the mixture. The probe will be vigorously mixed into the slurry and will be allowed to rest on the side wall of the beaker. The pH measurement will be allowed to stabilize and the temperature of the slurry will be obtained. Both the pH and the slurry temperature will be recorded. The temperature should be similar to the buffers used for probe standardization. The probe will be cleaned using distilled water between each measurement. References "],

The first focal point is on establishing a physical comparative measure that can be used to compare various sea cucumbers (Part 1 and 2). The second focal point is on establishing a uniform quality assessment measure that can be used to establish animal energy and condition as well as proximity to death (Part 3). Part 1: To create and assess a mass measure that identifies the characteristics of Cucumaria frondosa without being affected by active buoyancy adjustment (ABA). To create a rapid method for determining modified buoyant mass for Cucumaria frondosa that can be applied in automated systems and to establish its accuracy. To compare sea cucumber characterization methods (SI, immersed weight, MBM) for sea cucumber experiencing changing morphology due to active buoyancy adjustment (ABA). Part 2: To create and evaluate a predictive algorithm that uses sea cucumber characterization methods to predict process measures such as body wall thickness, wet body weight and dried body weight. Part 3: To establish the relationship between morphometric flux, flower position and animal energy levels and condition. 4.1 Modified Buoyant Mass Verification Thesis: Modified buoyant mass can be used to reliably categorize sea cucumbers for in-line automated assessments. 4.1.1 Initial Experimentation and Analysis Method Development Sea cucumber obtained from diver fisheries and stored at the Ocean Sciences Center will be used to assess initial experimental procedures and to develop Matlab algorithms. 30 selected animals of commercially viable sizes will be used to assess agitation methodologies as well as to establish procedures for identifying volume from stimulated measures and images. Displaced volume and major stimulated dimensions will be determined for use in establishing Matlab algorithms. 4.1.1.1 Agitation Method Determination Various stimulation methods will be employed to bring the animals to complete contraction in a uniform non-subjective way. Examples of methods to be assessed: Hand stimulation Dropping Tumbling The best stimulation method will be assessed and chosen for use in experiments in the larger work. Repeatability, subjectivity and ease of application in the field will be considered. 4.1.1.2 Creating Image Process Algorithms and Measuring Physical Attributes The method for assessing major dimensions using fish measuring boards will be perfected and standardized as well as the methods for obtaining digital photographs and gathering appropriate meta-data. 30 images obtained from these initial trials will be used to establish MATLAB algorithms that can be used to assess volume from further trials. Results from this initial experimentation will establish methods that will be used in the other experimental procedures. 4.1.2 Sampling for Larger Experiment Stratified random samples will be used in this experiment obtained from dragger landings in the 3PS general area of the St. Pierre Bank in Southern Newfoundland, Canada. For the purposes of this work, landings from general 3PS area will considered equivalently. It is felt that the use of stratification is important to ensure that there are enough animals for each size category. Samples will be obtained at the remote site and transferred to the Marine Institute Aquaculture Unit for storage and experimentation using available sea water recirculation systems. Sea water recirculation systems will be set up and equilibrated at current environmental sea water ambient temperature conditions which will involve obtaining sea water for the system from the Ocean Sciences Center and trouble shooting the operation. Samples will be obtained at three times: June and July (Early), July and August (Mid), August and September (Late), to observe any changes in response with time and proximity to spawning earlier in the year. The following notes describe the selection criterion important for each stratified category: To create stratified samples, 1 fish tote of each of the following linear size ranges, anus to tentacle (using fish measuring board), will be randomly obtained from landed materials, approximately 100 cucumbers per tote (30 kg). Tote 1: 100 &lt; 120 mm lengths Tote 2: 120 &lt; 140 mm lengths Tote 3: 140 &lt; 160 mm lengths Tote 4: &gt;160 mm lengths Tote 5: Random lengths Animals with withdrawn flower or nearly withdrawn flower will be chosen from landings to increase likelihood of transport survival. Chosen samples of sea cucumber will be placed in a large plastic bag and fresh sea water will be added. Bagged cucumbers and water will be placed in closed insulated containers and ice applied to the bag surface to maintain refrigeration temperatures during transport. Sea cucumbers will be transported to the Marine Institute’s aquaculture facility where they will be placed in the prepared sea water recirculation tanks according to the following schedule: Tank Series 1: Four (4) independent tanks will be used to store four different size grades of sea cucumber. 30 cucumbers per size grade will be placed in each of four tanks. Tank Series 2: A further four tanks will be used to hold the remaining animals for initial experimentation, one tank per size range. Remaining system tanks will be used to store tote 5 animals. 4.1.3 Part 1: Establish the Modified Buoyant Mass Methodology for Laboratory and Field Application This experiment focuses on determining the best method for measuring modified buoyant mass from live animals for both laboratory and in-line automation methods and compares the MBM results with measures used in other papers such as: SI and immersed weight. The determination of modified buoyant mass requires that a consistent displaced volume calculation method be identified that accounts for the various states of animal condition. This coupled with an accurate measure of wet weight will provide the MBM calculation. Using animals from Tank Series 2: Working with one size set at a time (repeating for four size sets), 10 animals will be isolated in each tank such that they can be accessed independently and not mixed (using perforated baskets). For each animal, the following tasks will be performed in order: Measure the immersed weight using a submerged platform on a balance similar to apparatus used by Gianasi, Hamel, and Mercier (2016). Zero the balance by applying the correct counterweight to prevent the platform from sinking. Place the animal on the platform while under the water and determine the immersed mass by adding counterweight to the balance. The difference in final and starting counterweight is the immersed weight of the animal. Remove each animal in turn from the aquaria and measure wet weight and displaced volume using laboratory techniques for MBM. Agitate animal until its shape no longer changes recording time and method of agitation. Measure major dimensions of each animal after agitation using a fish board. (Length (\\(D_1\\)), Horizontal Width (\\(D_2\\)), Vertical Width (\\(D_3\\))) Take digital image and record metadata. Return the animal to the holding system location for repeat trials. Trials will be repeated on each animal 3 times. Calculate the MBM using the data obtained and MATLAB algorithms established in initial work. Calculate and compare the MBM using three methods: Laboratory Method - \\(MBM=Wetwt-\\rho_{water}\\times DisplacedVol\\) Using Agitation – \\(MBM=Wetwt-[\\rho_{water}\\times 4/3 \\pi (D_1 D_2 D_3)/8]\\) Using digital photograph (vision) - \\(MBM = \\sum_{n=1}^{s}\\left ( \\pi \\frac {D_n^2}{4} \\right )\\times Thickness\\) Standard deviations of results will be obtained for each individual animal and will be compared using ANOVA. Each size set will have 30 observations, 120 observations for the full set. The best method for measuring MBM will be chosen from the results for continued experimentation. Results from MBM analysis will be compared with immersed weight and SI. Table 4.1: Factors in Part 1 of Modified Buoyant Mass Verification.

Initially the tank series will be maintained at a temperature similar to the ocean temperature. Sea water acquired from the Ocean Sciences Center will be used in the recirculating system. No nutrients will be provided to the animals during the holding period other than any present in the transferred sea water to limit mass increase from metabolism. Conditions in the tank will be changed to stimulate an ABA response in the sea cucumber, similar to conditions reported in Hamel et al. (2019). The MBM of individual animals will be measured under different conditions of ABA. Ten animals of each size set will be isolated in each tank using perforated trays, as used in Part 1. All analyses will be conducted three times for each individual animal. Initial MBM will be assessed for each animal in each size set which involves measuring stimulated external dimensions and wet weight. After measurement, each animal will be placed back in the holding tank in its tray. Temperature and turbidity of the tank water will be recorded during the experiments. The circulation tank temperature and then salinity will be changed incrementally to stimulate ABA response. Temperatures will be increased by 2°C and equilibrated allowing animals to respond to the change. MBM will be re-evaluated after equilibration, 24 hours. Temperatures will be returned to normal and re-equilibrated and MBM measurement will be repeated again. Salinity will then be increased by 1% by adding non-iodized sea salt to the recirculation water. MBM measurements will be repeated after equilibration for each animal in 4 sizes. It is hoped that changing temperature and changing salinity will prompt an ABA response which will be evidenced by changing wet weight and associated volume. MBM will be assessed for different conditions of the same animal to check for any variation of the value obtained. MBM values that are unchanged, or nearly unchanged, provide evidence that MBM can predict the condition of the sea cucumber independent of the influence of ABA.

For each size lot and each season time: Modified buoyant mass will be measured if previous data does not exist. (This includes a measure of wet weight and displaced volume.) Sea cucumber will be opened longitudinally along the body wall between leg rows. A sharp scalpel will be used to open the sea cucumber side wall to within 1 cm of the anal and flower ends. The sea cucumber will be opened above a labelled and pre-weighed plastic tray which will be used to retain all fluids and gut material from the process. The opened sea cucumber will be eviscerated into a plastic tray with all gut materials retained. Care will be taken to prevent damage of internal organs for inspection and identification. Gutted sea cucumber with flower (aquapharyngeal bulb) intact will be placed in a second labelled and pre-weighed plastic tray. Weight of tray and sea cucumber will be obtained and recorded per sample tag or number. Body wall thickness, not including the muscle bands, will be determined and recorded from each sample at three points using a caliper. Anal end, middle and flower end. The flower will be removed from each sea cucumber cutting the body as close to the flower ring as possible. The flower will stay with the body for dehydration, but the body weight will be determined independently using the same pre-weighed and labelled tray. Gut material with tray, body and flower with tray, will be placed in the Marine Institute heat pump drier for 24 hours or until constant weight is obtained. The drier will be set at 30°C and normal fan operation. Dehydrated weights will be obtained. The dehydrated sea cucumber body will be removed from the tray using tweezers and weighed separately. It and its flower will then be placed in a labelled plastic Ziplock bag for storage and further use. Each sea cucumber stored in the MI aquaculture recirculation system that is in viable condition will be sacrificed and data recorded as above.

Total Samples = 500 4.2 Predicting Process Outcomes from MBM and External Dimensions Thesis: Modified buoyant mass coupled with measured major dimensions of the excited live animal can be used to sort in process sea cucumber while predicting body wall thickness and dehydrated mass. For each of three seasons times, early, mid and late, three totes of sea cucumber will be randomly drawn from landed sea cucumber materials (NAFO subdivision 3PS). Each tote will contain approximately 30kg (90 kg per batch). 50 animals will be randomly chosen from the totes. Each animal will be hand stimulated until fully contracted. Wet weight, external stimulated dimensions and MBM will be measured and recorded using methods established in Part 1. A photograph will be taken of each animal using the technique from Part 1. Each animal will be placed in independent labelled trays (like a hotdog tray) for handling and sorting. Trays will be labelled with stimulated length and MBM value. Assessed sea cucumber will be sorted into stimulated length categories: 100&lt;120 mm, 120&lt;140 mm, 140&lt;160 mm, &gt;160 mm. Within each length category the cucumbers will be sorted from lowest to highest MBM. They will be orientated in a line lowest to left, highest to right for each category. The result will be photographed. Similarities and trends will be observed and recorded. The trayed animals will then be regrouped into common ranks of MBM regardless of size: &lt;10g, 10&lt;15g, 15&lt;20g, 20&lt;25g, &gt;25g. The animals will be regrouped in a line within each MBM rank, smallest to left, largest to right. The result will be photographed. Similarities and trends will be observed and recorded. Each animal, and all remaining stored animals, will then be sacrificed using methods identified in Part 3 of MBM verification with some modifications as follows: Sea cucumber will be opened longitudinally along the body wall between leg rows. A sharp scalpel will be used to open the sea cucumber side wall to within 1 cm of the anal and flower ends. The sea cucumber will be opened above a labelled and pre-weighed plastic tray which will be used to retain all fluids and gut material from the process. The opened sea cucumber will be eviscerated into a plastic tray with all gut materials retained. Care will be taken to prevent damage of internal organs for inspection and identification. Gutted sea cucumber with flower intact will be placed in a second labelled and pre-weighed plastic tray. Weight of tray and sea cucumber will be obtained and recorded per sample tag or number. Body wall thickness, not including the muscle bands, will be determined and recorded from each sample at three points using a caliper. Anal end, middle and flower end. The flower will be removed from each sea cucumber cutting the body as close to the flower ring as possible. The weight of flower will be independently measured and recorded for yield purposes. The body wall of the sea cucumber will then be blanched/boiled for 3 minutes using saturated steam or sea water (method to be confirmed with industry contacts) and then re-weighed noting any change in yield due to blanching/boiling. Gut material with tray, boiled body and flower with tray, will be placed in the Marine Institute heat pump drier for 24 hours or until constant weight is obtained. The drier will be set at 30°C and normal fan operation. Dehydrated weights will be obtained. The dehydrated boiled sea cucumber body will be removed from the tray using tweezers and weighed separately. It and its flower will then be placed in a labelled plastic Ziplock bag for storage and further use. Table 4.4: Factors in predicting process outcomes using live measures and MBM.

Regression analysis will be used to assess relationships between measured live parameters and process parameters such as: drained weight, gutted weight, body wall thickness and dried weight. The categorical average wall thicknesses will be compared using ANOVA among MBM ranges. Similarly, the average wet and dehydrated body mass for each sea cucumber within MBM ranges will be compared. 4.3 Using Morphological Flux to Assess Sea Cucumber (Cucumaria frondosa) Condition Thesis: Morphological flux coupled with flower position predicts proximity to death and correlates with quality degradation of Cucumaria frondosa. 4.3.1 Sampling For each sampling time, three fish totes, approximately 60 kg, of Cucumaria frondosa sea cucumber will be obtained from 3Ps landings, randomly selected from the top of the fishing vessel hold (greater likelihood of recovery), and transported to the Marine Institute using chilled sea water (Gianasi, Hamel, and Mercier (2016)). The animals will be transferred to a prepared salt-water recirculation system at the Marine Institute where they will be permitted to recover over 5 days for further experimentation. 4.3.2 Determining the relationship between morphological flux and animal condition post harvest Sea cucumber will be assessed for major stimulated dimensions, displaced volume and MBM and sorted into size categories, one holding system tray per size range. Cucumbers will be grouped into MBM categories: &lt;10g, 10&lt;15g, 15&lt;20g, 20&lt;25g, &gt;25g. 6 randomly selected animals from each size range will be placed in each of 5 - 2-litre containers (30 animals total) and will be stored at room temperature (20°C). At time 0h, 12h, 24h, 36h and 48h stimulation time to full contraction and relaxation flux will be measured from the samples. Each sample set will be evaluated for odor, color, flower position and general appearance. The body wall of each cucumber will be segmented and a composite sample obtained for pH analysis. pH will be assessed using the method of Woyewoda et al. (1986). This procedure will be repeated for each of the size ranges over three sampling periods: early season, mid season and late season. Changing stimulation response times will be correlated with changing pH and changes in observed physical characteristics. Graphical analysis will be used to establish the interrelationship between morphometric flux, sea cucumber condition and proximity to death. Optimally, sea cucumbers will be near death by the end of the experiment to establish a measure of end point. Additionally, the impact of harvest time and MBM will observed through comparative analysis. Table 4.5: Factors in determining the relationship between morphological flux and sea cucumber condition.

["conclusions-and-dissemination.html", "6 Conclusions and Dissemination", " 6 Conclusions and Dissemination Establishing a uniform method for assessing the suitability of live sea cucumbers during harvesting and handling can help harvesters and processors make sensible decisions around resource utilization. Predicting the harvested outcome from live animals can help to improve resource sustainability by discouraging overfishing through economic drivers. In addition, in-process grading and sorting can help processors optimize the value of their resources which stands to improve the overall worth and sustainability of the industry. It is expected that at least three publications or conference paper/presentations will come from this work. In addition, provided the outcomes from this work are important and relevant, meetings will be conducted with industrial partners and other interest groups in the fishery. "],
